# Project: EZTravel

# This project is an app for macOS that asks a user for details about flights that he/she may be interested in taking, and prints out a list of flights that match the criteria in another window. It makes use of an API from the Amadeus Travel Innovation Sandbox. The project can be tested using Xcode on a Mac.

# This project was written using Swift.

> Minor bug: The submit button must be clicked twice for updated results to show.
